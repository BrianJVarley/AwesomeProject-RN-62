### Running your React Native application
Run react-native start inside your React Native project folder:

```language
cd AwesomeProject
npx react-native start
```

If you use the Yarn package manager, you can use yarn instead of npx when running React Native commands inside an existing project.

On another terminal, run npx react-native run-android:

cd AwesomeProject
npx react-native start
react-native start starts Metro Bundler, which you can read more about here.

Run react-native run-android inside your React Native project folder:

```language
npx react-native run-android
```
